Attempts to implement types (defclasses or deftypes) for all supported
LSP interfaces. The various omitted types are excluded due to one of:
- Not supported yet in the LSP
- TODOs and/or tentatively pointless, like integer and decimal
- Being "baked in" to the jsonrpc library, like
  https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#abstractMessage.
  This project is intentionally avoiding all manual implementation of the JSON-RPC protocol.

TODO: Is there any way to properly type and/or validate outgoing jsonrpc messages?
